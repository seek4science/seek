= Backing Up


== Backing up the database

You can backup the database using mysqldump[http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/mysqldump1.html] using the following syntax.
The database name, username and password follows that which was used in the install guide - however the username and
password should be different for you if you'd changed them as suggested.

  mysqldump -umysqluser -pmysqlpassword seek_production > seek_production.sql

== Backing up files

The is also no harm in backing up the entire SEEK directory, however the essential directory to backup it the <em>filestore/</em> directory.
This is the directory that contains all asset files, and other potentially important files.


== Restoring

Should you ever need to restore the database you can do so by logging into mysql

  mysql -umysqluser -pmysqlpassword

and creating the database (assuming it no longer exists), connecting to it, and importing the dump:

  >create database seek_production;
  >\r seek_production
  >\. ./seek_production.sql

The files can be restored simply by copying the <em>filestore/<em> directory back into the SEEK root directory.


== Incremental Backups

Incremental backups allow you to recover a particular version of the backup from a given point in time, depending upon the
frequency of the backup and when the back ups started.

For our own SEEK deployments, we use rdiff-backup[http://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/non-gnu/rdiff-backup/] within a simple
script that is run nightly using crontab[http://crontab.org/]. e.g.

  #!/bin/sh

  logger "Local Rdiff backup started"

  BACKUPDIR=/var/backups/seek
  INCLUDE=/etc/rdiff-backup/backup.include
  EXCLUDE=/etc/rdiff-backup/backup.exclude


  /usr/bin/rdiff-backup --terminal-verbosity 9 --print-statistics --terminal-verbosity 2  --exclude-globbing-filelist $EXCLUDE  --include-globbing-filelist $INCLUDE  --exclude / / $BACKUPDIR

  logger "Local Rdiff backup complete"

where <em>backup.include</em> is a file that includes a list of paths (files or directories) to be backed up, and <em>backup.exclude</em> is a list of paths that should be excluded.

<em>BACKUPDIR</em> can also be an ssh url, e.g <em>backup@backupserver.co.uk:/var/local/backup/</em>
