= Upgrading SEEK

If you have an existing SEEK installation, and you haven't done so already, please take a moment to fill out our very short,optional {SEEK Registration Form}[http://www.sysmo-db.org/seek-registration].
Doing so will be very useful to us in the future when we try and raise further funding to develop and support SEEK and the associated tools.

<b>Always backup your SEEK data before starting to upgrade!!</b> - see the {Backup Guide}[link:doc/BACKUPS.html].

This guide assumes that SEEK has been installed following the {Installation Guide}[link:doc/INSTALL.html] guide. It assumes it is
a production server that is being updated, and that commands are run from the root directory of the SEEK application.

If your current installation is not linked to to the SEEK BitBucket Mercurial repository, it can still easily be updated by
taking the next stable tag, reconfiguring the database configuration to point at your existing database, and copying across the
<em>filestore/</em> directory. The upgrade steps can then be followed, with the Mercurial (hg) steps omitted.

== Identifying your version

You can tell which version you have installed by looking at the <em>config/version.yml</em> file, so for example version 0.13.2
looks something like:

  major: 0
  minor: 13
  patch: 2

== General notes about versions and upgrading

<b>If upgrading from a version earlier than v0.11.x please contact our GoogleGroup at http://groups.google.com/group/seek-development</b>

When upgrading between versions greater than v0.11.x you need to upgrade to each released minor version in order incrementally (i.e. 0.13.x -> 0.14.x -> 0.15.x -> 0.16.x, you can skip patch versions such as 0.13.3).
The released versions are listed below:

* 0.11.x
* 0.13.2
* 0.13.3
* 0.14.0
* 0.14.1
* 0.15.0
* 0.15.1
* 0.15.2
* 0.15.3
* 0.15.4
* 0.16.0
* 0.16.1
* 0.16.2
* 0.16.3
* 0.17.0
* 0.17.1

<em>(Note there was no 0.12.x version released externally, this was an internal release)</em>

Each version has a tag in mercurial, which has the format of <em>v</em> prefix followed by the version - e.g. v0.11.1, v0.13.2, v0.17.1

When upgrading between minor versions (i.e. from 0.11.x to 0.13.x) it is necessary to run a seek:upgrade rake task to perform
upgrade changes and import any new data. The upgrade task may require an internet connection, and sometimes can take some time to run,
so please be patient. There are instructions for upgrading between each minor version listed below, but they will generally follow the
same pattern.

When upgrading between patch versions (i.e between 0.13.0 and 0.13.2) it should
only be necessary to a db:migrate rake task. Using seek:upgrade should still work, but could take a lot of unnecessary time.

== Steps to upgrade from 0.16.x to 0.17.x

Upgrading follows the standard steps:

    RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job stop
    bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop RAILS_ENV=production
    hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.17.1
    hg update
    hg merge # only required if you've made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
    hg commit -m "merged" # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
    bundle install --deployment
    bundle exec rake seek:upgrade RAILS_ENV=production
    bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
    bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production

    bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=production # to restart the search server
    RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start
    touch tmp/restart.txt


== Steps to upgrade from 0.15.x to 0.16.x

First there are additional dependencies you will need, which on Ubuntu 12.04 can be installed with:

    sudo apt-get install poppler-utils libreoffice

On Ubuntu 10.04:

    sudo apt-get install poppler-utils openoffice.org openoffice.org-java-common

Libre Office is a background service which is called by convert_office plugin, to convert some document types (ms office documents,
open office documents, etc.) into pdf document.

The command to start libre office in headless mode and as the background process:

    nohup soffice --headless --accept="socket,host=127.0.0.1,port=8100;urp;" --nofirststartwizard > /dev/null 2>&1

If you run on production server, using apache and phusion passenger, you will need to run the Libre Office service under www-data user.
To do this it will need to create a working directory in /var/www. The name of the directory
changes between versions, but will be called something similar to libreoffice or .openoffice.org2. The easiest way to create this directory
is to make a note of the permissions for /var/www, then make it writable to www-data, start the service, and then put the permissions on /var/www back to
what they were originally.

    sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www

Then to start the service manually you use:

    nohup sudo -H -u www-data soffice --headless --accept="socket,host=127.0.0.1,port=8100;urp;" --nofirststartwizard > /dev/null 2>&1

The 8100 port is used by default, if you'd like to run on another port, you need also to synchronize the changed port with the default soffice_port setting for convert_office plugin in config/environment.rb

We recommend the Libre Office service is setup using an init.d script, following the same procedures for delayed job using the script found at:
https://gist.github.com/3787679

If you have problem with converting speed, you should upgrade OS to Ubuntu 12.04 to use Libre Office.
Or you can install libre office 3.5 from PPA, but there could be problems later on when upgrading OS.
Here are the command to install libre office from PPA:

   sudo apt-get purge openoffice* libreoffice*
   sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/libreoffice-3-5
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install libreoffice

Other than this, the remaining steps are the same standard steps are previous versions:

    RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job stop
    bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop RAILS_ENV=production
    hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.16.3
    hg update
    hg merge # only required if you've made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
    hg commit -m "merged" # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
    bundle install --deployment
    bundle exec rake seek:upgrade RAILS_ENV=production
    bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
    bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production

    bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=production # to restart the search server
    RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start
    touch tmp/restart.txt

== Steps to upgrade from 0.14.x to 0.15.x

SEEK 0.15 upgraded Rails to the latest 2 version,2.3.14. This requires an update of Rubygems to 1.6.2. You can update rubygems directly by running

    gem update --system 1.6.2

or install from scratch by reading the INSTALL guide. You can also use RVM[https://rvm.io/]. SEEK 0.15 also runs fine on the latest Rubygems (currently 1.8.24) but
you will get some deprecation warnings.
You can check you have the correct version of rubygems by running

    gem -v

Then you will need to install additional dependency:

    sudo apt-get install git

Once Rubygems has been updated and additional dependency has been installed, the upgrade is the typical:

    RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job stop
    bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop RAILS_ENV=production
    hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.15.4
    hg update
    hg merge # only required if you've made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
    hg commit -m "merged" # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
    bundle install --deployment
    bundle exec rake seek:upgrade RAILS_ENV=production
    bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
    bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production

    bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=production # to restart the search server
    RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start
    touch tmp/restart.txt


== Steps to upgrade from 0.13.x to 0.14.x

These are the fairly standard steps when upgrading between minor versions. Note, the seek:upgrade task can take a while
if there are many people and assets in your SEEK, as it needs to populate some tables for the default subscriptions (for
email notifications).

    RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job stop
    bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop RAILS_ENV=production
    hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.14.1
    hg update
    hg merge # only required if you've made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
    hg commit -m "merged" # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
    bundle install --deployment
    bundle exec rake seek:upgrade RAILS_ENV=production
    bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
    bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production

    bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=production # to restart the search server
    RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start
    touch tmp/restart.txt

== Steps to upgrade from 0.11.x to 0.13.x

There follows the commands required to upgrade. Anything after # are notes and do not need to be included in the command run.
There are a few additional steps for this upgrade due to the switch from Solr to Sunspot as the search system,
and the introduction of Delayed Job for background processing.

First there is an additional dependency you will need, which on Ubuntu 10.04 or Debian can be installed with:

    sudo apt-get install libxslt-dev

on Ubuntu 12.04 this will be:

    sudo apt-get install libxslt1-dev

then the following steps will update the SEEK server:

    bundle exec rake solr:stop RAILS_ENV=production # this is specific to this upgrade, since the command to stop and start the search has changed.
    hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.13.3
    hg update
    hg merge # only required if you've made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
    hg commit -m "merged" # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
    bundle install --deployment
    bundle exec rake seek:upgrade RAILS_ENV=production
    bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=production # to restart the search server
    bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:reindex RAILS_ENV=production  # to reindex
    bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
    bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production

SEEK v0.13.x now uses a Ruby tool called {Delayed Job}[https://github.com/tobi/delayed_job] to handle background processing
which now needs to be started using:

    RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start

And now SEEK should be ready to restart. If running together with Passenger Phusion as described in the install guide
this is simply a case of:

   touch tmp/restart.txt

If you auto start solr with an init.d/ script - this will need updating to reflect the change to sunspot:solr:start. The
updated script should look something like: https://gist.github.com/3143434

== Steps to upgrade between patches (e.g. between 0.16.0 to 0.16.3)

This example shows upgrading from v0.16.0, v0.16.1, or v0.16.2 to v0.16.3 as an example, but the process is the same for upgrading between patch versions unless
otherwise stated. You can upgrade directly from one patch version to another, skipping the intermediate versions (so you can upgrade directly 0.16.0 to 0.16.3 without first having to upgrade to 0.16.1)

  hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.16.3
  hg update
  hg merge # if necessary
  hg commit -m "merged" # if necessary
  bundle install --deployment
  bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
  bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
  bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production

  RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job stop
  RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start

  touch tmp/restart.txt
