= Installing SEEK under a sub URI

Running under a sub URI means running seek with a path below the main domain URI - e.g http://myhost.org/seek

This requires a couple of small changes on-top of the standard installation. This only covers installing in a production
environment running with Apache, but the principle is the same for other webservers.

It is assumed here that the suburi will be /seek and these steps should be carried out once the rest of the installation is complete.

== Modifying the Apache configuration

The Apache configuration requires a small change to pass an additional couple of parameters to Passenger. Please add the following
to your virtual host settings, just before the Directory definition.

  Alias /seek /srv/rails/seek/public
  <Location /seek>
    PassengerBaseURI /seek
    PassengerAppRoot /srv/rails/seek
  </Location>

You can find out more about this configuration at https://www.phusionpassenger.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html#deploying_rails_to_sub_uri

== Setting the relative_url_root

In the file <em>config/application.rb</em> towards the end withing the inner block, either uncomment or add the line:

  config.relative_url_root = '/seek'

This setting is necessary to create the correct paths when compiling the assets, and also for the delayed-job background tasks.
An alternative to this is to set the RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT environment variable when starting/stopping the seek:workers or compiling assets.

Now re-compile the assets

  rm -rf public/assets
  bundle exec rake assets:precompile

Now restart Apache, and if you have already ran seek clear the cache with:

  bundle exec rake tmp:clear

You should now be able to visit and use seek at http://localhost/seek
