= Installation

SEEK is based upon the Ruby on Rails platform. Although the information on this page should provide you with everything you need to get a basic installation of
SEEK up and running, some background reading on Ruby on Rails would be beneficial if it is new to you. Documentation and resources describing Ruby on Rails can be found
at http://rubyonrails.org/documentation. Since SEEK uses v2.3.8 of Rails, http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v2.3.8/ and http://api.rubyonrails.org/v2.3.8 may be useful as well.

We recommend that you run SEEK on a Linux system. All of the examples here describe installing on an Ubuntu (10.04 LTS) or Debian system, but should be easily transferrable to other Linux systems such as Fedora.

Although possible, installing and running Ruby on Rails on a Windows system is troublesome and is not covered here.

== Prerequesites

We recommend you use ruby, version 1.8.7.

MySQL server needs to be installed installed, along the development package (required to compile the MySQL rubygem). We use the Ubuntu/Debian packages <em>mysql-server</em> and <em>libmysqlclient15-dev</em>

The ImageMagick libraries need to be installed, as these are required by the rmagic gem. We use the The Ubuntu/Debian package <em>libmagick++9-dev</em>

You will need a minimal build environment, as some of the ruby gems require compilation. The Ubuntu/Debian package <em>build-essentials</em> should be sufficient

SEEK uses Lucene as its search engine, and this requires that java is installed. We use the Sun Java 1.6 package <em>sun-java6-jdk</em>

<b>Note:</b>If using Ubuntu, you will need to enable Partner sources to install sun-java6-jdk . To do this edit <em>/etc/apt/sources.list</em> and uncomment the lines so that they appear
as follows:

  ## This software is not part of Ubuntu, but is offered by Canonical and the
  ## respective vendors as a service to Ubuntu users.
  deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu lucid partner
  deb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu lucid partner

(if you need more information, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu#Adding+Canonical+Partner+Repositories).

If you needed to add partner repositories, and its a good idea anyway, you should do an apt-get update

  sudo apt-get update

If using Ubuntu or Debian, the following commands should install most the packages you need:
 
  sudo apt-get install wget mercurial ruby rdoc ri libopenssl-ruby ruby-dev mysql-server libssl-dev build-essential openssh-server 
  sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient16-dev libmagick++-dev libxml++2.6-dev sun-java6-jdk graphviz libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxslt-dev libxml2-dev

if you are intending to develop SEEK you will probably also want to use:

  sudo apt-get install curl irb
  
if setting up for production deployment using the {Passenger Phusion (modrails)}[http://www.modrails.com/] module you can save a step later by also using:

  sudo apt-get install apache2-mpm-prefork apache2-prefork-dev libapr1-dev libaprutil1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev

You now need to install rubygems (1.3.7). Rather than install through apt-get, we recommend downloading and installing from the rubygems website: http://rubygems.org/pages/download.
The following commands should install rubygems for you on a Ubuntu/Debian system.

  cd /tmp
  wget http://production.cf.rubygems.org/rubygems/rubygems-1.3.7.tgz
  tar zfxv rubygems-1.3.7.tgz
  cd rubygems-1.3.7/
  sudo ruby ./setup.rb
  cd /usr/bin/
  sudo ln -s gem1.8 gem
  cd -



== Getting the source code

Our source code is stored within the {Sysmo-DB Google Code Repository}[http://code.google.com/p/sysmo-db/], using Mercurial[http://mercurial.selenic.com/] as the version control system. 

For a stable version, you should check out according to a stable tag. Our current tag is v0.11.1, so to retrieve this version you should use:

  hg clone https://sysmo-db.googlecode.com/hg/ -r v0.11.1 seek
  
Bundler[http://gembundler.com/] is used to manage gems, so to install the required gems you first need to install the bundler gem:

  gem install -d bundler rake
  
Then from within the sysmo-seek directory run

  bundle install  
  
If you are requested for a root or sudo password, but you do not have this level of access then you should use

  bundle install --deployment
  


== The RAILS_ENV environment variable

If you are setting up SEEK as a production environment, rather than for development, you should set the RAILS_ENV variable before proceeding

  export RAILS_ENV=production

== Rebranding SysMO SEEK for other projects

If you are running SEEK for a project other than SysMO, copy config/initializers/seek_local.rb.pre to config/initializers/seek_local.rb. This file contains several constants that you should set, to reflect the name of your project/application.

To insert your application/project name into the help documents for SEEK, and to remove the logos/links to SEEK's 'related projects and friends' use

  rake seek:rebrand

If you only want to change the help documents, you can instead use

  rake seek:rebrand_help_docs

== Configuring the database

Copy config/database.default.yml to config/database.yml and edit accordingly - either MySQL or SQLite3 should work (you will need to install the <em>sqlite3-dev</em> package and the <em>sqlite3-ruby</em> gem)

To add users to the MySQL database, first login to the database as an administrator (root by default) and issue a GRANT command along the lines of the example below
(for clarity, this uses a username of <em>mysqluser</em> and password <em>mysqlpassword</em>.
<b>You are obviously recommended to use a different username and password</b> on a server exposed to the internet).

    > mysql -uroot -p
    Enter password:
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MySQL connection id is 1522
    Server version: 5.1.37-1ubuntu5.1 (Ubuntu)

    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

    mysql> CREATE USER 'mysqluser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mysqlpassword';
    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'mysqluser'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;


Run the rake tasks (the final task installs some default controlled vocubulary data)

  rake db:create:all
  rake db:schema:load
  rake seek:seed

== A quick test

You can quickly check that everything is in order by running the system tests as follows

  rake db:test:prepare
  rake test

== Starting the server

You can now start the server with the command

  ./script/server

If running in production mode, you should start the server with

  ./script/server -e production

== Creating the Admin user

Once the server is running you should visit the page http://localhost:3000

If there are no users present in the system (and there should not be at this stage) you will be requested to provide login details, and some basic information about your profile
(you can always come back and modify the profile information and your password. You cannot modify your login name).

Once created this user will become the admin user of the system.

== Administering the system

Once logged in as an administrator, you will notice a link on the right-hand side of the tabs/search bar "Admin Enabled". Selecting this will provide you with some
admin facilities for creating new projects, institutions and profiles.

Here you can also define additional administrator users.
