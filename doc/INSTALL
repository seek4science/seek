= Installing SEEK

== Introduction

If you have installed SEEK, please take a moment to fill out our very short,optional {SEEK Registration Form}[http://www.sysmo-db.org/seek-registration]

If you have any problems or questions, you should contact us. The following link will give you details on how to {Contact Us}[link:doc/CONTACTING_US.html]

SEEK is based upon the Ruby on Rails platform. Although the information on this page should provide you with everything you need to get a basic installation of
SEEK up and running, some background reading on Ruby on Rails would be beneficial if it is new to you. Documentation and resources describing Ruby on Rails can be found
at http://rubyonrails.org/documentation .

SEEK is based on the 3.2 version of Rails, and requires Ruby 2.1.

We recommend that you run SEEK on a Linux system. This guide is based on an Ubuntu (12.04 LTS) system.
However, running on other Linux distributions the main difference is the name of the required packages that have to be installed for that distribution, other than that the steps will be the same.
If you want to install on different distribution or version please visit {Other Distributions}[link:doc/OTHER-DISTRIBUTIONS.html] and see if it is listed there.

You will need to have <em>sudo</em> access on the machine you are installing SEEK, or be able to login as root. You will also need an active internet connection throughout
the installation process.

Although possible, installing and running Ruby on Rails on a Windows system is troublesome and is not covered here.

== Installing packages

These are the packages required to run SEEK with Ubuntu 12.04 (Desktop or Server). For other distributions or versions please visit our {Other Distributions}[link:doc/OTHER-DISTRIBUTIONS.html] notes.

You should run an update first

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade

Now install the packages:

  sudo apt-get install mysql-server

Pay attention to what you use for the 'MySQL root' password when requested - you will need this later.

The remaining packages are:

  sudo apt-get install wget curl mercurial ruby libssl-dev build-essential openssh-server git libreadline-dev
  sudo apt-get install libxml++2.6-dev openjdk-7-jdk libsqlite3-dev sqlite3
  sudo apt-get install poppler-utils libreoffice libmysqlclient-dev libmagick++-dev libxslt1-dev libpq-dev

Installing these packages now will make installing Ruby 1.9.3 easier later on:

  sudo apt-get install libtool gawk libyaml-dev autoconf libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev automake bison libffi-dev

== Development or Production?

The following steps are suitable for either setting up SEEK for development, or in a production environment. However, when setting up
a production environment there are some minor differences - please visit {Installing SEEK for Production}[link:doc/INSTALL-PRODUCTION.html]

== Setting up Ruby and RubyGems with RVM

We strongly encourage that you use {RVM}[https://rvm.io/] for managing your Ruby and RubyGems version. Although you can use the version that comes with your linux distribution,
it is more difficult to control the version you use and keep up to date.

To install RVM follow the steps at https://rvm.io/rvm/install . The current basic installation method is to run:

  \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash

to save restarting your shell run:

  source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm

if you already had RVM installed, bring it up to date with:

  rvm get stable

now install Ruby 2.1.3

  rvm install ruby-2.1.3

you may be asked for your password so that some additional packages can be installed. You will then need to wait for Ruby to be downloaded and compiled.


Now you just need to create the <em>Gemset</em> for SEEK. RVM allows what it calls <em>Gemsets</em> to seperate the gems installed, in isolation from each other, for different applications.
To create the gemset run:

  rvm gemset create seek



== Getting SEEK

Now you are ready for installing SEEK. To fetch the latest version of SEEK <em>(v0.21.0)</em> change to the directory you want to install it and then run:

  git clone https://github.com/seek4science/seek.git
  cd seek/
  git checkout tags/v0.21.0

Now to install the ruby gems SEEK needs:

  gem install bundler
  bundle install

== Setting up the Database

You first need to setup the database configuration file. You need to copy a default version of this and then edit it:

  cp config/database.default.yml config/database.yml
  nano config/database.yml

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> you should at least change the default username and password. Change this for each environment (development,production,test).

Now you need to grant permissions for the user and password you just used (changing the example below appropriately). You will need the root password you created for mySQL when installing the package. e.g:

  > mysql -uroot -p
  Enter password:
  Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
  Your MySQL connection id is 1522
  Server version: 5.5.32-0ubuntu0.12.04.1 (Ubuntu)

  Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

  mysql> CREATE USER 'mysqluser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mysqlpassword';
  mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'mysqluser'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

Now to create the database for SEEK and seed it with the default data, run:

  bundle exec rake db:setup

You can now start SEEK for the first time, just to test things are working

  bundle exec rails server

... and visit http://localhost:3000 and a SEEK page should load.

However, before continuing, stop SEEK with CTRL+C and start up some services.

== Starting the SEEK services

This describes a quick way to start up the services SEEK needs. If setting up a production server, following these steps is
fine to check things are working. However, you should also read the {Installation for Production}[link:doc/INSTALL-PRODUCTION.html] guide
for automating these services.

=== Starting and Stopping the Search Service

For a new installation, by default search is disabled. Before running the service you may need to enable search in the Administration setting.
The SEEK server needs restarting whenever search is enabled or disabled.

<b>If search is enabled and the following service is not running, you will get errors when adding or updating information in SEEK.</b>

SEEK search is based upon the {Apache Lucene Solr}[http://lucene.apache.org/solr/] service. To start this service run:

  bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start

and to stop run:

  bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop

Optionally, there is also a configuration file for configuring the port and host that Solr runs on - which is important if running multiple SEEK
installations on the same machine. If you wish to override the default ports then copy config/sunspot.default.yml to sunspot.yml and change the settings.

The following task can also be at any time if there is need to force all content to be reindexed (such as after a period of running SEEK with search turned off).

  bundle exec rake seek:reindex_all

=== Starting and Stopping the Background Service

SEEK uses {Delayed Job}[https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job] to process various jobs. It is important this service is running.

To start delayed job run:

  bundle exec rake seek:workers:start

and to stop run:

  bundle exec rake seek:workers:stop

you can also restart with

  bundle exec rake seek:workers:restart

=== Starting and Stopping the SOFFICE service

SEEK uses the soffice service provided by LibreOffice[https://www.libreoffice.org/] to convert various document formats to PDF and Text - to allow them to be viewed
in a web browser, and to make them indexable to the search. To start soffice run:

  soffice --headless --accept="socket,host=127.0.0.1,port=8100;urp;" --nofirststartwizard > /dev/null 2>&1 &

and to stop it run:

  killall -15 soffice


== Starting SEEK

You can now start up SEEK again running:

  bundle exec rails server

== Creating an Administrator

When you first visit SEEK at http://localhost:3000 with no users present, you will be prompted to create a new user. This user will be the administrator of SEEK
(you can change to or add other users in the future). Create a username and password, and then fill out your profile, and you will be ready to use SEEK.

You will be prompted to fill out our very short Registration form. <b>Please do if you haven't done so already</b>, as this greatly assists the future support and funding of SEEK.


== Final steps

If you are setting up SEEK for production use, please now return to our {Installing SEEK for Production Guide}[link:doc/INSTALL-PRODUCTION.html].

You should also now read our {Administration Guide}[link:doc/ADMINISTRATION.html] for details of some basic tasks and settings.
