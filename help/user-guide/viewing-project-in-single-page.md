In Experiment View, Experiments (Investigation, Study, Assay) compliant to the ISA framework (ISA-JSON compliant: true) display their Samples and linked protocols in a tree view on the left side of the page. Each item's details are shown and accessible from the center of the page, and as more items are added, the tree will expand.
