# Simulating Models with JWS Online

Models uploaded to SEEK in SBML format can be simulated in SEEK using [JWS Online](http://jjj.mib.ac.uk/]).

To run a model on JWS Online you need to click the Simulate Model on JWS button.

The interface in SEEK will change to the JWS run environment. In this environment you are able to run a range of analysis on the model including steady state, control analysis, flux balance analysis, and more. 
You can find out more about the JWS interface [here](link to http://jws-docs.readthedocs.io/)
