# Legacy Biosamples

Biosamples was a Sample type that was generated as part of the SysMO project. 
This used to be the only sample type that was available to use within SEEK. 
If you want to use the original SysMO Biosamples template, you can search for this within the Sample Types. 
It is called “SysMO Biosample” and contains all the attributes of the original Biosample.
