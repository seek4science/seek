# Requesting membership of a Project

If you didn't specify a Project during [registration](registering.html), and you don't know how to contact the [Project administrators](roles.html#project-administrator),
you can request to join a project.

To do so, first navigate to the project page. As long as the Project has an administrator, and you are not yet already
a member, a "Request Membership" button should be available:

After clicking the button, there is an option to also provide some details about who you are and why you wish to join.

The request, and message, will be delivered to all the Project administrators, who will then be able to add you to the 
project. Once added, you will receive an email notifying you.

It is only possible to make a request once every 12 hours.
