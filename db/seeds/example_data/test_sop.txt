Standard Operating Procedure: Reconstituted Enzyme System for Gluconeogenesis Studies
Version 1.0
Date: 2024

1. OBJECTIVE
This SOP describes the standardized protocol for reconstituting the gluconeogenic enzyme system from Sulfolobus solfataricus to study carbon metabolism efficiency at high temperatures.

2. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
- Handle all enzymes and chemicals in appropriate laboratory conditions
- Use heat-resistant equipment for high-temperature incubations
- Follow institutional safety guidelines for biochemical assays
- Ensure proper ventilation when working with volatile compounds

3. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
3.1 Purified Enzymes:
- Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK)
- Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
- Triose phosphate isomerase (TPI)
- Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase/phosphatase (FBPAase)

3.2 Substrates and Cofactors:
- 3-Phosphoglycerate (3PG) - starting substrate
- ATP and NADPH for cofactor regeneration
- Pyruvate kinase and glucose dehydrogenase for regeneration system
- Assay buffer (pH optimized for thermostable enzymes)

3.3 Equipment:
- High-temperature water bath or incubator (70C)
- Spectrophotometer for kinetic measurements
- Temperature-controlled cuvettes
- Precision pipettes and tips

4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Enzyme Preparation:
1. Thaw purified enzymes on ice
2. Determine protein concentrations using Bradford assay
3. Prepare enzyme stock solutions in assay buffer
4. Adjust enzyme ratios for optimal pathway flux

4.2 Assay Setup:
1. Pre-warm assay buffer to 70C
2. Add cofactors (ATP, NADPH) to reaction mixture
3. Include cofactor regeneration system (pyruvate kinase, glucose dehydrogenase)
4. Add substrate (3PG) to initiate reaction

4.3 Kinetic Measurements:
1. Monitor 3PG consumption over time
2. Measure F6P (fructose 6-phosphate) production
3. Track intermediate concentrations (GAP, DHAP)
4. Record temperature stability throughout 1-hour incubation period
5. Document any intermediate degradation due to thermolability

5. DATA COLLECTION
- Record initial substrate and product concentrations
- Monitor reaction progress at 5-minute intervals
- Calculate conversion efficiency and carbon loss
- Document pathway flux rates under different enzyme ratios

6. QUALITY CONTROL
- Verify enzyme activity before each experiment
- Include negative controls (no enzyme, no substrate)
- Monitor reaction pH throughout incubation
- Check for non-specific product formation

7. EXPECTED RESULTS
- Constant consumption rate of 3PG over 1-hour period
- Steady production of F6P as final product
- Measurable concentrations of GAP and DHAP intermediates
- Approximately 50% carbon loss due to intermediate instability at high temperature

8. DATA ANALYSIS
- Plot substrate consumption and product formation over time
- Calculate pathway efficiency and intermediate stability
- Compare experimental results with mathematical model predictions
- Analyze the impact of temperature on pathway performance
