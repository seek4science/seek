# openSEEK

The combined openBIS & SEEK Docker package is no longer supported, and each need to be installed separately.

openBIS can be download and installed from the [openBIS download page](https://wiki-bsse.ethz.ch/display/bis/openBIS+Download+Page), or can be still be run as a [stand-alone Docker instance](https://hub.docker.com/r/openbis/debian-openbis)
