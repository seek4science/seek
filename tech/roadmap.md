# Roadmap

This is an outline of plans the core FAIRDOM-SEEK development team will be working on in the near future.

It is an overview of the main priorities, and milestones. FAIRDOM-SEEK is developed following an Agile development process, meaning some of the features and timing may change - however, these items are very high in our priorities. 

They are expected to be added to FAIRDOM-SEEK in roughly the order they are presented here.
