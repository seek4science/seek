## Introduction to Docker

Docker is a toolset for running applications in isolated containers. They
are similar to virtual machines, but run on the same hardware and kernel as the
host system. Docker can be used to create and run images which are a complete
package of the application and its system and runtime dependencies.

For more information please visit the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/)
