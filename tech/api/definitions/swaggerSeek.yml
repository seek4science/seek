    <a name="api"></a>The JSON API to FAIRDOM SEEK is a [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) specification describing how to read and write to a SEEK instance.

    The API is defined in the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification) currently in [version 2](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md)

    Example IPython notebooks showing use of the API are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/seek4science/seekAPIexamples)

    ===

    ## Policy
    <a name="Policy"></a>
    A Policy specifies the visibility of an object to people using SEEK. A <a href="#projects">**Project**</a> may specify the default policy for objects belonging to that <a href="#projects">**Project**</a>

    The **Policy** specifies the visibility of the object to non-registered people or <a href="#people">**People**</a> not allowed special access.

    The access may be one of (in order of increasing "power"):

    * no_access
    * view
    * download
    * edit
    * manage

    In addition a **Policy** may give special access to specific <a href="#people">**People**</a>, People working at an <a href="#institutions">**Institution**</a> or working on a <a href="#projects">**Project**</a>.

    ## ContentBlob
    <a name="ContentBlob"></a>
    <a name="contentBlobs"></a>
    The content of a <a href="#dataFiles">**DataFile**</a>, <a href="#documents">**Document**</a>, <a href="#models">**Model**</a>, <a href="#sops">**SOP**</a> or <a href="#presentations">**Presentation**</a> is specified as a set of **ContentBlobs**.

    When a resource with content is created, it is possible to specify a ContentBlob either as:

    * A remote ContentBlob with:
      * **URI to the content's location**
      * The original filename for the content
      * The content type of the remote content as a [MIME media type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type)
    * A placeholder that will be filled with uploaded content
      * **The original filename for the content**
      * **The content type of the content as a [MIME media type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type)**

    The creation of the resource will return a JSON document containing ContentBlobs corresponding to the remote ContentBlob and to the ContentBlob placeholder. The blobs contain a URI to their location.

    A placeholder can then be satisfied by uploading a file to the location URI. For example by a placeholder such as 

    ```
    "content_blobs": [
      {
        "original_filename": "a_pdf_file.pdf",
        "content_type": "application/pdf",
        "link": "http://fairdomhub.org/data_files/57/content_blobs/313"
      }
    ],
    ```

    may be satisfied by uploading a file to http://fairdomhub.org/data_files/57/content_blobs/313 using the <a href="#uploadDataFileContent">uploadDataFileContent</a> operation

    The content of a resource may be downloaded by first *reading* the resource and then *downloading* the ContentBlobs from their URI.

                  description: "The currently used mathematical models for medical\
                    \ treatment at\nthe individual or population level are largely\
                    \ phenomenological and have limited\nquantitative predictive power.\
                    \ It is usually not possible to predict the effect\nof an intervention\
                    \ in a specific process or to predict the effect of a pharmaceutical\n\
                    drug since the step or enzyme on which the intervention/drug works\
                    \ is not explicit\nin the model.\r\n\r\nTaking HIV pathogenesis\
                    \ as an example, the immune system\nresponse, vaccine exposure,\
                    \ and drug regimen all affect viral replication and\nonward transmission,\
                    \ which may be a single parameter in a model. Or in higher-level\n\
                    scenarios of epidemiological intervention, condom distribution,\
                    \ behavioural\nmessaging, and vaccines may all be affecting a\
                    \ single transmissibility parameter."

                    \u20AC\u201CParnas pathway of Plasmodium falciparum\ntrophozoites\
                    \ were kinetically characterized and their integrated activities\n\
                    analyzed in a mathematical model. For validation of the model,\
                    \ we compared model\npredictions for steady-state fluxes and metabolite\
                    \ concentrations of the hexose\nphosphates with experimental values\
                    \ for intact parasites. The model, which is\ncompletely based\
                    \ on kinetic parameters that were measured for the individual\n\
                    enzymes, gives an accurate prediction of the steady-state fluxes\
                    \ and intermediate\nconcentrations. This is the first detailed\
                    \ kinetic model for glucose metabolism\nin P. falciparum, one\
                    \ of the most prolific malaria-causing protozoa, and the\nhigh\
                    \ predictive power of the model makes it a strong tool for future\
                    \ drug target\nidentification studies. The modelling workflow\
                    \ is transparent and reproducible,\nand completely documented\
                    \ in the SEEK platform, where all experimental data\nand model\
                    \ files are available for download."
