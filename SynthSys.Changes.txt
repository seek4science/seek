# Changes made to the main seek4scinece branch
# In reverse chronological order



# Symbolic links in 3 configuration files have to be replaced by
# actual content of the files they were pointing to as the links
# are not supported by windows and were lost on pushing to the server.
# The modified files are:
config/initilizers/seek_configuration.rb -> seek_configuration.rb-openseek
config/locales/en.yml -> en.yml-openseek
db/seeds.rb -> seeds.rb-openseek
