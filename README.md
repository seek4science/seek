## About FAIRDOM-SEEK

The FAIRDOM-SEEK platform is a web-based resource for sharing heterogeneous scientific research datasets,models or simulations, processes and research outcomes. It preserves associations between them, along with information about the people and organisations involved.
Underpinning SEEK is the ISA infrastructure, a standard format for describing how individual experiments are aggregated into wider studies and investigations. Within SEEK, ISA has been extended and is configurable to allow the structure to be used outside of Biology.

FAIRDOM-SEEK is incorporating semantic technology allowing sophisticated queries over the data, yet without getting in the way of your users.

For an example of FAIRDOM-SEEK please visit our [Demo](http://demo.seek4science.org/).

To see FAIRDOM-SEEK being used for real science, as part of [FAIRDOM](http://fair-dom.org) please visit [FAIRDOMHub](http://fairdomhub.org)
