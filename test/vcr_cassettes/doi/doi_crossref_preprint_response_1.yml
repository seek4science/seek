        Encephalomyelitis\/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME\/CFS) is an enigmatic condition
        characterized by fatigue that is unaided by rest and by exacerbation of symptoms
        after exertion (post-exertional malaise or &amp;ldquo;PEM&amp;rdquo;). There
        is no definitive molecular marker or known underlying pathological mechanism
        for the condition. Increasing evidence for aberrant energy metabolism suggests
        a role for mitochondrial dysfunction in ME\/CFS. Our objective was therefore
        to measure mitochondrial function and cellular stress sensing in actively
        metabolising patient blood cells. We immortalized lymphoblasts isolated from
        51 ME\/CFS patients diagnosed according to the Canadian Consensus Criteria
        and an age- and gender-matched control group. Parameters of mitochondrial
        function and energy stress sensing were assessed by Seahorse extracellular
        flux analysis, proteomics, and an array of additional biochemical assays.
        As a proportion of the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR), the rate of ATP
        synthesis by Complex V was significantly reduced in ME\/CFS lymphoblasts,
        while significant elevations were observed in Complex I OCR, maximum OCR,
        spare respiratory capacity, nonmitochondrial OCR and &amp;ldquo;proton leak&amp;rdquo;
        as a proportion of the basal OCR. This was accompanied by an elevation of
        mitochondrial membrane potential, chronically hyperactivated TOR Complex I
        stress signalling and upregulated expression of mitochondrial respiratory
        complexes, fatty acid transporters and enzymes of the &amp;beta;-oxidation
        and TCA cycles. By contrast, mitochondrial mass and genome copy number, as
        well as glycolytic rates and steady state ATP levels were unchanged. Our results
        suggest a model in which ME\/CFS lymphoblasts have a Complex V defect accompanied
        by compensatory upregulation of their respiratory capacity that includes the
        mitochondrial respiratory complexes, membrane transporters and enzymes involved
        in fatty acid &amp;beta;-oxidation. This homeostatically returns ATP synthesis
        and steady state levels to &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; in resting cells,
        but may leave them unable to adequately respond to acute increases in energy
        demand as the relevant homeostatic pathways are already activated.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.20944\/preprints201909.0043.v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,5]],"date-time":"2019-09-05T04:28:52Z","timestamp":1567657732000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["An
