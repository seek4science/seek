AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the associations between occupational exposure to
      pesticides and extrahepatic biliary tract carcinoma in men, a population-based
      case-control study was carried out. METHODS: Cases (n = 104), aged 35-70,
      diagnosed in 1995-1997, were sampled by active reporting systems from hospitals.
      Controls (n = 1,401) were a random sample of the general male population.
      Information on occupation and confounding factors was obtained by questionnaires.
      Exposures were quantified with respect to time, application methods, and use of
      personal protective equipment. Intensity was evaluated by using a published
      algorithm which weighted the exposure assigned according to the use of personal
      protective equipment and mode of application. Logistic regression analyses were
      conducted adjusted for gallstones, age, and country. RESULTS: Being ever exposed
      to pesticides resulted in an odds ratio (OR) of 1.0 [95%-confidence interval (CI)
      0.6-1.6]. A modestly elevated risk was found for backpack mounted sprayers OR =
      1.4 [95% CI 0.7-2.6] and vine farmers OR = 2.5 [95% CI 0.9-7.2]. Using time
      periods and exposure frequency as intensity measure, no elevated risks were
      found. The only exception was year of maximum exposure which yielded an OR of 1.6
      [95% CI 0.7-3.5]. However, no clear trend was observed in this analysis.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study does not rule out that pesticide exposure represents an
      occupational risk factor for extrahepatic biliary tract carcinoma, but no
      indication of a strong association was observed. Some modes of exposure were
      weakly, albeit not significantly associated with carcinoma risk. The observed
      estimates of effects may be influenced by a lack of precise exposure assessment.
      Different chemical compositions of pesticides were utilized during a long time
      span of pesticide exposure, and it should be considered that the exposure is
      assessed with substantial uncertainty that could non-differential and bias
      results toward the null.
