# Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and

#
# Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
#
# Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
# conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
# original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
# and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
# following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
# exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
#
#      Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
#      intended for use by those authorized to give the public
#      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
#      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
#      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
#      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
#      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
#      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
#      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
#      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
#      licensed material, or material used under an exception or
#      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
#     wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
#
#      Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
#      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
#      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
#      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
#      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
#      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
#      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
#      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
#      the licensed material may still be restricted for other
#      reasons, including because others have copyright or other
#      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
#      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
#      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
#      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

#
# By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
# to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
# Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
# extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
# granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
# these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
# consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
# Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
#
#
# Section 1 -- Definitions.
#
#   a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
#      Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
#      and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
#      arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
#      permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
#      Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
#      Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
#      Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
#      synched in timed relation with a moving image.
#
#   b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
#      and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
#      accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
#
#   c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
#      closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
#      performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
#      Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
#      categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
#      specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
#      Rights.
#
#   d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
#      absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
#      fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
#      Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
#      agreements.
#
#   e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
#      any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
#      that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
#
#   f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
#      or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
#      License.
#
#   g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
#      terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
#      all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
#      Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
#
#   h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
#      under this Public License.
#
#   i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
#      process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
#      as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
#      dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
#      available to the public including in ways that members of the
#      public may access the material from a place and at a time
#      individually chosen by them.
#
#   j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
#      resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
#      the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
#      as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
#      equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
#
#   k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
#      under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
#
#
# Section 2 -- Scope.
#
#   a. License grant.
#
#        1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
#           the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
#           non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
#           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
#
#             a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
#                in part; and
#
#             b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
#
#        2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
#           Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
#           License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
#           its terms and conditions.
#
#        3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
#           6(a).
#
#        4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
#           Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
#           all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
#           and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
#           Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
#           authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
#           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
#           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
#           Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
#           simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
#           (4) never produces Adapted Material.
#
#        5. Downstream recipients.
#
#             a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
#                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
#                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
#                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
#                Public License.
#
#             b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
#                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
#                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
#                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
#                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
#                Material.
#
#        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
#           may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
#           are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
#           with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
#           the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
#           provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
#
#   b. Other rights.
#
#        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
#           licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
#           privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
#           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
#           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
#           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
#           Rights, but not otherwise.
#
#        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
#           Public License.
#
#        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
#           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
#           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
#           under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
#           licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
#           reserves any right to collect such royalties.
#
#
# Section 3 -- License Conditions.
#
# Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
# following conditions.
#
#   a. Attribution.
#
#        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
#           form), You must:
#
#             a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
#                with the Licensed Material:
#
#                  i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
#                     Material and any others designated to receive
#                     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
#                     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
#                     designated);
#
#                 ii. a copyright notice;
#
#                iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
#
#                 iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
#                     warranties;
#
#                  v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
#                     extent reasonably practicable;
#
#             b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
#                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
#
#             c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
#                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
#                hyperlink to, this Public License.
#
#        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
#           reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
#           which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
#           reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
#           hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
#           information.
#
#        3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
#           information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
#           reasonably practicable.
#
#        4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
#           License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
#           Material from complying with this Public License.
#
#
# Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
#
# Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
# apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
#
#   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
#      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
#      portion of the contents of the database;
#
#   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
#      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
#      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
#      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
#
#   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
#      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
#
# For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
# replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
# Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
#
#
# Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
#
#   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
#      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
#      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
#      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
#      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
#      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
#      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
#      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
#      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
#      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
#
#   b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
#      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
#      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
#      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
#      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
#      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
#      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
#      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
#      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
#
#   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
#      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
#      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
#      waiver of all liability.
#
#
# Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
#
#   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
#      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
#      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
#      terminate automatically.
#
#   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
#      Section 6(a), it reinstates:
#
#        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
#           it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
#           violation; or
#
#        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
#
#      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
#      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
#      of this Public License.
#
#   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
#      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
#      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
#      will not terminate this Public License.
#
#   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
#      License.
#
#
# Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
#
#   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
#      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
#
#   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
#      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
#      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
#
#
# Section 8 -- Interpretation.
#
#   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
#      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
#      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
#      be made without permission under this Public License.
#
#   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
#      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
#      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
#      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
#      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
#      conditions.
#
#   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
#      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
#      Licensor.
#
#   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
#      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
#      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
#      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
