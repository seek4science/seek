The new user Aaron Spiggle just signed up and indicated that they are a member of the following projects and/or institutions:

Project: Project X

If you know this person is a genuine member of a project you administer, you can add them by:
    - following the link to the project shown below
    - select the Administration menu
    - select the Administer Project members button

Links to these projects are:

    -pr_name- - http://localhost:3000/projects/-pr_id-

If the institution does not exist, you can create the new institution. To do this:
    - Go to Institutions tab at http://localhost:3000/institutions
    - Click the 'New Institution' button

After the institution has been created successfully, you need to assign it to the project following the steps described above.

If you need to contact the person, their details can be found at: http://localhost:3000/people/-person_id-, and their email address is aaron@email.com .
