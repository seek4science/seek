We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics, which requires the use of cookies.

Google Analytics records the pages you visited on the site, and information about the type of computer and web browser you use. **All of this information is anonymous** – so we don’t know who you are; just that somebody visited our site.

The information we gather from Google Analytics helps us measure which parts of the site are useful and popular, and which parts do not work so well. This allows us to tailor and improve the site for our visitors.
