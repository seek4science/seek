  about_project: "You need to be a member of a <strong>%{project}</strong> before you can register content.
    A %{project} can contain one or more people, and gives some additional background details, and credit, about the content being registered. It can be used to describe and promote
    the work you are doing.
    Being in a %{project} allows you to easily share with others whilst collaborating, and also provides useful defaults such as Sharing permissions and License."

  create_join_project_options: "You have the option to either <strong>Join</strong> a %{project} you already know about, or <b>Create</b> a new one."    
    

  about_programme: "A <strong>%{programme}</strong> holds a collection of one or more %{projects}. If you create a %{programme} you become its administrator and you have the ability to
create and administer additional %{projects} within it without additional approval from a site administrator. A %{programme} can describe and promote
an activity that is larger than a %{project}, and can be associated with a funding."

  about_managed_programme: "If you don't think a %{programme} is necessary, and you won't expect to need to create additional %{projects} in the future, 
you can choose to have a %{project} linked to a site managed %{programme} instead."

  report_a_bug: '<h2>Issue tracker</h2>
  <p>
  To report a bug or other issue, it is preferable to use the %{issue_tracker_link}. A Github account is required, and your report will be public and open 
  to comments. Before reporting the issue, have a look and search through the current issues to see if the problem has already been raised - if so, add a comment so
   we know it is also affecting you.
  </p>
  <h2>Feedback form</h2>
  <p>
  Alternatively, if you are unable to use the %{issue_tracker_link}, or the issue is of a private nature, then you can use the %{feedback_link}.
