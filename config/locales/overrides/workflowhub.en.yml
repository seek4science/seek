  info_text:
    institution: "An Organization in WorkflowHub is any kind of entity through which people are affiliated. It can be an academic institution, company, department, club etc."
    programme: "A Space is an umbrella to group one or more Team."
    project: "A Team represents a group of one or more people collaborating together on a particular activity. All resources in WorkflowHub are owned by one or more Teams."
    investigation: "Investigation is a high level description of the research carried out within a particular Team."
    study: "A Study is a particular hypothesis, which you are planning to test, using various techniques. A Study must belong to one Investigation and it can contain one or more Assays."
    assay: "An Assay is in general the application of a process (SOP) that converts an input material or data (incoming samples) into a new material or data (outgoing samples). An Assay must belong to one Study."
    model: "A Model is a file containing a computer model of a biological or biochemical network or process. A Model file must be associated with one or more Teams."
    sop: "SOP stands for Standard Operating Procedure and it describes a process. A SOP file must be associated with one or more Teams. If associated with an Assay, the SOP describes the process to reproduce that Assay."
    data_file: "Data files can be any file containing data in any format. A Data file must be associated with one or more Teams."
    publication: "Existing publications can be registered in WorkflowHub. A Publication must be associated with one or more Teams."
    workflow: "A Computational Workflow describes the complex multi-step methods that lead to new outputs. A Workflow must be associated with one or more Teams."
    document: "A Document is a file containing human-readable information, e.g. workflow documentation. A Document must be associated with one or more Teams."
    collection: "A Collection is a curated collection of resources registered in WorkflowHub. A Collection must be associated with one or more Teams."
    presentation: "Presentations associated with one or more Teams can be registered in WorkflowHub."
    event: "Events associated with one or more Teams, happening on specified dates and at a specific location, actual or virtual can be registered in WorkflowHub."
    sample: "A Sample is an entity (material or data) that can be converted into a new item (material or data) via a process (SOP), physical or computational. Samples must be associated with one or more Teams."
    sample_type: "A Sample Type is a form with samples' attributes needed to describe and create Samples in WorkflowHub. A Sample type must be associated with one or more Teams."
    template: "Templates are blueprints that can be reused and applied to Study and Assay for describing Samples. Templates must be associated with one or more Teams."
    organism: "An Organism is identified by an entry in the NCBI ontology. An Organism must be associated with one or more Teams in order to be registered in WorkflowHub."
    file_template: "A File Template describes conforming Data files. For example, a File Template that is a Word document may describe conformant PNG images."
