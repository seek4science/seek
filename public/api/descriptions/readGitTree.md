<a name="readGitTree"></a>A **readGitTree** operation will return the <a href="#gitTree">Git tree (directory)</a> at a given path (or root) of a resource (e.g. a workflow), provided the authenticated user has "download" rights. 

The response includes some metadata and a listing of all the blobs (files) or subtrees (sub-directories) under the tree.
