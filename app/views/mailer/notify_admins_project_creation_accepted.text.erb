Hi,

The request to create a <%= t('project') %> has been responded to and approved <%= @responder.nil? ? 'automatically' : "by #{@responder.name}" %>.

The <%= t('project') %> created is '<%= @project.title %>' ( <%= project_url(@project) %> ), and was originally requested by
'<%= @requester.name %>' ( <%= person_url(@requester) %> ).

This is an automated email.
