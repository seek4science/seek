Hi <%= @name %>,

Welcome to <%= Seek::Config.instance_name %>. You have now registered and activated your account.

You may now update your profile at <%=  edit_person_url(@person) %>

If during the registration you indicated you are a member of a <%= t('project') %> you will need to wait until you have been assigned to that <%= t('project') %> by a <%= t('project') %> administrator.
Otherwise, you could request to join projects, read here to see how: <%= Seek::Help::HelpDictionary.instance.help_link(:join_project)-%>.

<% if Seek::Config.programme_user_creation_enabled %>
It is also possible to create your own <%= t('programme') %> and <%= t('project').pluralize %> - for more information please read <%= Seek::Help::HelpDictionary.instance.help_link(:programme_self_management) %>.
<% end %>
For further documentation, see the User Guide: <%= Seek::Help::HelpDictionary.instance.help_link(:get_started)-%>.

If you require any assistance, please contact one of the following administrators:
