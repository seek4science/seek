Hi <%= @gatekeeper.name -%>,

    The <%= Seek::Config.instance_name %> user <%= @publisher.name -%>, <%= person_url(@publisher) -%>, has cancelled a request previously sent to you to publish the following item(s):
    <% @resources.each do |resource|%>
        <% controller=resource.class.name.underscore.pluralize -%>
        <%= resource.model_name.human -%>: <%= resource.title -%> - <%= url_for(:action=>:show,:controller=>controller,:id=>resource, :only_path => false) -%>

    <% end %>

    You do not need to take action.

    You can contact <%= @publisher.first_name.capitalize -%> by replying to this email.

    This is an automated email.
