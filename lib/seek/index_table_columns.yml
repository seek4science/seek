# Definitions for the column options available for the table based index view
#
# - general: - these are a broad set of general configurations common to most resources. If a particular resource doesn't respond then the column is ignored.
#     - required: these columns are always shown and cannot be added or removed
#     - default: columns that are shown by default, but can be removed
#     - additional_allowed: additional columns that are available to be selected, but not shown by default
#
# the other definitions relative to specific resource types, defined by the key, and are for defining columns specific to that particular resource type, or tweaking the order.
# The options: required, default, and additional_allowed have the same meaning, and the columns are prepended to the start.
# Columns previously defined under general can be bought to the front by redefining them here and any later duplicates are removed.
# There is an additional option - 'blocked', which can be used to override and prevent columns defined under general being available for the specific resource type.
#
# NOTE that the first 3 default columns are currently used for the condensed view
